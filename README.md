# Data Science Portfolio [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo%20status-Active-green.svg)](https://shields.io/)


This repository contains some of the independent and acedemic projects that i have worked on throughout my data science journey which i find worth sharing. I try my best to keep it updated with the latest data science projects and  make them as curated and open-source as possible.

>Comments, advices or interesting ideas are always welcomed, just drop me an email at mhlee2907@gmail.com.
